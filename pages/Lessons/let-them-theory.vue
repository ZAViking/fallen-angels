                <li>When you go into control mode, imagine you are in a row boat paddling against the current. It is hard and a fight. That is what it is like trying to control people.</li>
                <li>Detach yourself from the emotion and mental struggle you get yourself into when you are thinking about what other people are doing or how things should be going.</li>
                <li>Your need to control things is a form of anxiety.</li>
                <li>People who want to control everything have a lot of fears.</li>
                <li>It is a form of love.</li>
                <li>Why do you have to be so offended about everything? Or hurt about everything? Not everything is that serious.</li>
                <li>You working yourself worked up about something, you getting yourself annoyed.</li>
                <li>That is detachment.</li>
