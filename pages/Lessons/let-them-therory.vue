        <h1>"Let people do what they need to do"</h1>

        <h2>1st reason you need this:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When you go into control mode, imagine you are in a row boat paddling against the current. It is hard and a fight. That is what it is like trying to control people.</li>
            <li>Detach yourself from the emotion and mental struggle you get yourself into when you are thinking about what other people are doing or how things should be going.</li>
            <li>Your need to control things is a form of anxiety.
                <ul>
                    <li>They have a lot of fears.</li>
                    <li>Form of love.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Why do you have to be so offended about everything? Or hurt about everything? Not everything is that serious.
                <ul>
                    <li>You working yourself worked up about something, you getting yourself annoyed.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>That is detachment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2nd reason you need this:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You to let people fail. You got to give people the room to gorw, the room to learn and the room to take personal responsibility.</li>
            <li>If you constantly save people, they will always depend on you and they will never grow. Otherwise you make them weaker.</li>
            <li>You have a need for it, you try and control people.</li>
            <li>Stop trying to force other people to do what you want them to do.</li>
            <li>When they come to you, they come to learn.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3rd reason you need this:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Let people be themselves.</li>
            <li>Distracts us from what we don’t want to deal with.</li>
        </ul>
